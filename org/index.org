* Overview
(site last updated {{{modification-time(%Y %B %d)}}})

I am a climate scientist interested in tropical overturning circulations
([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon][monsoons]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell][Hadley cells]], and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone][Intertropical Convergence Zone]]):

- Why they exist
- Why they aren't bigger or smaller, farther poleward or equatorward
- How they ebb and flow over the course of each year
- How well we can predict their variations from year to year
- How those year-to-year variations affect agricultural and economic outcomes
- How they may have changed in Earth's history
- How they may change in Earth's future
- How they behave in other planetary atmospheres.

Please see my [[file:publications.org][Publications]] page for more.

I work at the [[https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/][Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] at [[https://www.columbia.edu/][Columbia University]], where I
am funded by an [[https://www.earth.columbia.edu/][Earth Institute]] Postdoctoral Fellowship and advised by [[http://www.columbia.edu/~ahs129/home.html][Adam
Sobel]] and [[https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~biasutti/][Michela Biasutti]].  Along with [[https://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2371/][Mark Cane]] and collaborators in
India, we are working on a project seeking to improve forecasts of Indian
monsoon summer rainfall on seasonal timescales.

I also co-lead the "[[https://diynamics.github.io/][DIYnamics]]" project that seeks to improve the teaching of
meteorology, climate science, and other planetary-scale sciences at the K-12
through graduate school levels by developing inexpensive, easy-to-use kits for
performing physical demonstrations of core scientific concepts.  Please the
DIYnamics [[https://diynamics.github.io/][website]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnUHxOSVY4G4OFbF8XL1qUg][YouTube]] channel for more.

I am also interested in developing software tools for scientists in the Python
programming language.  Please see my [[https://aospy.readthedocs.io][aospy]] package and [[file:resources.org][Resources]] page for more.

Please contact me (information below) with any questions about my research or
anything else you find on this site.  Thanks!
