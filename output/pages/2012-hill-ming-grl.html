<h2>Hollywood-style&nbsp;Logline</h2>
<p>Spraying sea salt into subtropical low-lying clouds could buy the
world time to decarbonize, but things don&#8217;t add up when three
different regions are seeded at&nbsp;once.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Exhaustively decarbonizing the world economy will be difficult, so
much so that many fear we won&#8217;t be able to do so in time to avert
dangerous risks of climate change.  A band-aid solution, then, is
&#8220;geoengineering,&#8221; i.e. the deliberate manipulation of Earth&#8217;s climate
so as to counteract greenhouse gas warming.  Many geoengineering
methods have been suggested, such as spraying reflective sulfate
particles into the stratosphere in order to (slightly) dim the sun.
In this work, we investigated another, called cloud&nbsp;seeding.</p>
<p>(The term cloud seeding has two main connotations, one related to
climate and the other to weather.  The climate one is this
geoengineering method.  The weather one refers to efforts to
manipulate storms by injecting them with aerosols, silver iodide being
a popular&nbsp;option.)</p>
<h2>Behind the&nbsp;scenes</h2>
<p>This was my first ever peer-reviewed article!  The work began in
Summer 2010 when I worked as an intern with Yi Ming at <span class="caps">GFDL</span> as part of
the <span class="caps">NOAA</span> Hollings Scholarship program.  Yi had performed the
simulations ahead of time, and I spent the 10 weeks while there
learning how to analyze them.  So on a personal level, the actual
scientific content of this work, satisfied enough though I am with how
it turned out, was vastly less important than the knockon effects of
getting to work with Yi, as we took a liking to one another,
ultimately fueling my coming back to Princeton to work with him for my
PhD in Fall&nbsp;2011.</p>
<p>In a harbinger of how my future research would tend to go (and still
goes), completing the work took longer than I had allocated, and so we
worked on it off and on in spurts over the next two years, before
finally getting it submitted to <span class="caps">GRL</span> in early summer of&nbsp;2012.</p>
<h2>Postscripts</h2>
<ul>
<li>May 2020: It has been fun to see in recent months that this very
  applied work has been useful for some theoretical work.  In
  particular, Jian Lu at <span class="caps">PNNL</span> let Yi an dI know that it informed his
  work on developing a Green&#8217;s function for&nbsp;climate.</li>
